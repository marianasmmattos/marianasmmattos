<p>I'm 22 years old from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. I really love challenges and creating stuff, that's why I'm working with software engineering. Mostly, I've been dealing with frontend development, but i do also seek for learning software architecture and project patterns. It's just the beginning of a long journey, am i right?</p> 

<p>I'm self-taught but also really like taking part of courses or whatever makes me learn with other people. That's kind of what i live for! I do also love watching serial killer movies but... Hope you guys can handle it.
