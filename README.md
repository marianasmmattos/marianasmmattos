# <center> ✨👋🏻 Welcome to my work & hobbie 👋🏻✨ </center>
Here you can see my journey trought FullStack Development. Still, i'd rather say i'm FrontEnd only until now. Hope you guys enjoy it! My e-mail and LinkedIn are open to conversation, feedbacks, suggestions and whatelse you think that would be helpful.

## 📚 Here's my stack so far:
<ul>
  <li> Vanilla JavaScript & Typescript</li>
  <li> HTML5, CSS3 & Bootstrap</li>
  <li> ReactJS with Styled-Components</li>
  <li> NodeJS with Express</li>
  <li> SQLite3</li>
  <li> Figma & Git</li>
</ul>

We could say I can easily handle an interative API based website. Well, about me? I'm 22 years old from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. I really love challanges and creating stuff, that's why I'm working with development. I'm self-taught but also really like taking part of courses or whatever makes me learn with other people. That's kind of what i live for! I do also love watching serial killer movies but... Hope you guys can handle it.
