<p>Here you can see my journey trought FullStack Development. I'd rather say I'm a FrontEnd only until now. We could say I can easily handle an interative API based website. Hope you guys enjoy it! My e-mail and LinkedIn are open to feedbacks, suggestions and whatelse you think that would be helpful.

<p>Well, about me? I'm 22 years old from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. I really love challenges and creating stuff, that's why I'm working with development. I'm self-taught but also really like taking part of courses or whatever makes me learn with other people. That's kind of what i live for! I do also love watching serial killer movies but... Hope you guys can handle it.
